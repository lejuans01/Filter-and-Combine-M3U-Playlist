# Filter and Combine M3U Playlist
[Playlist Filter](https://lejuans01.github.io/Filter-and-Combine-M3U-Playlist/)
Our New Website Is Now Live at [M3U TOOLS](https://m3u-tools.tiiny.site/). Here you will find all of our New Tool-Set's, It's a work in progress..

This web-based tool allows users to upload an M3U playlist file or provide a URL to an M3U playlist. It then enables users to filter and combine the contents of the playlist based on specific categories. Users can select the categories they are interested in, and the tool will generate a combined playlist for download.

## Features:

* **Upload or URL input**: Users can either upload an M3U file or paste a URL to an M3U playlist.
* **Category selection**: The tool automatically detects available categories in the playlist and displays them as checkboxes. Users can select which categories to include in the combined playlist.
* **Download the combined playlist**: Once the categories are selected, the program generates a new playlist that only contains the chosen categories, which can be downloaded.

## How It Works:

1. **Upload an M3U file or enter a URL**: You can either upload a local M3U file or paste a URL linking to an M3U file.
2. **Select categories**: After the playlist is loaded, the tool will display a list of categories. Choose the categories you want to include in your new playlist.
3. **Combine and download**: After selecting categories, the tool generates a new M3U playlist containing only the chosen categories. A download link will be provided.

## Instructions:

1. Upload your M3U file or provide the URL of your M3U playlist.
2. Select the categories you want to include.
3. Click on the button to add the selected categories to the combined playlist.
4. Once the playlist is ready, click the download link to save the combined playlist.
5. If upload of imported `URL` doesn't work, then click as-if you want to `Choose a file` ( to clear the feild ), then try `URL` again to continue.
